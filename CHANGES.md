# Unreleased

- [NEW] New API for specifying the SSLSocketFactory. This can used to
  enhance security in specific environments. To set this SSLSocketFactory,
  call the `setSecureSSLSocketFactory` method on the `ConnectOptions`
  object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient` constructor.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Hostname verification and certificate chain
  validation are now enabled by default. To disable these additional
  checks when the client connects to the database,
  `setSSLAuthenticationDisabled(true)` can be called on the `ConnectOptions`
  object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient` constructor.
- [NEW] New API for deleting databases, `CloudantClient.deleteDB(String name)`
- [FIX] Fixed querying of next/previous page in a descending view.
- [FIX] Fixed handling of non-ASCII characters when the platform's
  default charset is not UTF-8.
- [FIX] Fixed encoding of `+`, `=` and `&` characters when they are used
  in the query part of a URL.
- [Deprecated] Deprecated `CloudantClient.deleteDB(String name, String confirm)`
  API.
