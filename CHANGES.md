# Unreleased
- [FIX] `NullPointerException` when calling `AllDocsResponse.getIdsAndRevs` for a request with
  multiple non-existent keys (IDs).
- [IMPROVED] Preserved path elements from `URL`s used to construct a `ClientBuilder`. 
This allows, for example, a `CloudantClient`connection to use a gateway with a `URL` like
 `https://testproxy.example.net:443/cloudant/mydb`.

# 2.6.2 (2016-09-20)
- [FIX] `NoClassDefFoundError: com.squareup.okhttp.Authenticator` for version 2.6.1 if the optional
  okhttp dependency was not included.

# 2.6.1 (2016-09-15)
- [FIX] `NoClassDefFoundError: com.squareup.okhttp.Authenticator` for version 2.6.0 if the optional
  okhttp dependency was not included.

# 2.6.0 (2016-09-12)
- [NEW] Enabled `reduce` and other reduce related parameters to be set when using
  `MultipleRequestBuilder`.
- [FIX] Consumed response streams in `client.shutdown()` and `CookieInterceptor` to prevent
  connection leaks.
- [NEW] Added functionality to remove attachment from document by attachment name.
- [FIX] Issue authenticating with a proxy server when connecting to a HTTPS database server.
- [FIX] Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if using an unsupported proxy type.
- [IMPROVED] Documentation for connecting to and authenticating with proxy servers.
- [FIX] `java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to parse `Set-Cookie` headers.
- [FIX] `NullPointerException` in `CookieInterceptor` when no body was present on response.

- [IMPROVED] Added warning messages for JVM DNS cache configuration settings that could impede
  client operation during cluster failover.

# 2.5.1 (2016-07-19)
- [IMPROVED] Made the 429 response code backoff optional and configurable. To enable the backoff add
  an instance of a `Replay429Interceptor` with the desired number of retries and initial backoff:
  `ClientBuilder.account("example").interceptors(new Replay429Interceptor(retries, initialBackoff))`
  A default instance is available using 3 retries and starting with a 250 ms backoff:
  `Replay429Interceptor.WITH_DEFAULTS`. To replicate the backoff of version 2.5.0 create an instance
   using `new Replay429Interceptor(10, 250l)`.
- [FIX] Fixed places where streams where not closed and could cause connections to leak.

# 2.5.0 (2016-05-24)
- [NEW] Handle HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests` with blocking backoff and retries.
- [NEW] Added `DesignDocumentManager.list()` to return all design documents defined in a database.
- [NEW] Added an optional `SettableViewParameters.STALE_NO` constant for the default omitted case of
  the stale parameter on a view request.
- [NEW] Added `descending` option for changes feed.
- [NEW] Added `parameter` option for changes feed to allow specifying a custom query parameter on
  the request for example to be used by a filter function.
- [NEW] Added HttpConnection logging filters for HTTP request method and URL regex.
- [IMPROVED] Added additional logging output and documentation.
- [IMPROVED] Documentation for `Replication` class.

  documents into the `DesignDocument` class.
- [FIX] `PreconditionFailedException` was never thrown when calling `createDB("dbname")` when the
  database already existed.
- [FIX] Documentation that suggested calling `database("dbname", false)` would immediately throw a
  `NoDocumentException` if the database did not exist. The exception is not thrown until the first
  operation on the `Database` instance.
- [FIX] `ClassCastException` when the server responded `403` with a `null` reason in the JSON.

# 2.4.3 (2016-05-05)
- [IMPROVED] Reduced the length of the User-Agent header string.
- [IMPROVED] Use a more efficient HEAD request for getting revision information when using
  `DesignDocumentManager.remove(String id)`.
- [FIX] Regression where `_design/` was not optional in ID when using `DesignDocumentManager` methods.
- [FIX] Issue where `use_index` was specified as an array instead of a string when only a design
  document name was provided.
- [FIX] Issue where empty array was passed for `use_index` option when `FindByIndexOptions.useIndex()`
  was not used.
- [FIX] Incorrect method names in overview documentation example for connecting to Cloudant service.

# 2.4.2 (2016-04-07)
- [IMPROVED] Use the JVM default chunk size for HTTP content of unknown length.

- [NEW] Documentation for logging in project javadoc `overview.html`.
- [UPGRADED] Upgraded optional okhttp to 2.7.5.
- [FIX] Issues with the changes feed, replication, or getting database info when using Cloudant Data
  Layer Local Edition because sequence IDs were incorrectly always treated as strings not JSON.
- [FIX] Issue of `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure` on
  IBM Java with okhttp. SSL connections using okhttp are now configured to use the JVM enabled
   protocols and cipher suites in the same way as the `HttpURLConnection`.
- [FIX] Issue where a `java.net.ProtocolException` was thrown if the cookie had expired when a
  request that included a body was sent. Note that the client no longer uses the
  `Expect:100-continue` header on requests.
- [FIX] Fix issue where design documents would not be updated if only the
  `indexes` field was updated.
- [FIX] The `equals` and `hashcode` methods for `Document` and `ReplicatorDocument` failed to compare
  revision identifier and some other fields.
- [FIX] Issue where connections could leak because streams were not closed.
- [DEPRECATED] The `InputStream` setters `HttpConnection.setRequestBody(InputStream)` and
  `HttpConnection.setRequestBody(InputStream, long)`. Use of the new `InputStreamGenerator` is
  preferred because it allows for request replays.
- [CHANGE] Moved HTTP and interceptor code into a separate jar.

# 2.3.0 (2016-02-12)
- [NEW] Constructor for `Database` subclasses.
- [IMPROVED] Documentation for `Database.findByIndex` to show complete selector.

  attachments.

# 2.2.0 (2016-01-08)
- [IMPROVED] Request a session delete on client shutdown.
- [IMPROVED] Consistently encode all parts of request URLs and handle additional special characters.
- [FIX] Stopped integers in complex key arrays turning into floats when using view pagination with tokens.
- [FIX] Replaced string operations with GSON objects when parsing JSON.
- [FIX] Enabled specification of multiple drilldown parameters for search.
- [NEW] `Database.invokeUpdateHandler` now handles POST requests.

# 2.1.0 (2015-12-04)
- [IMPROVED] Included error and reason information in message from `CouchDbException` classes.
- [IMPROVED] Added HTTP status code to `Response` objects.
- [IMPROVED] Added parameter pagination option for views. See `ViewRequest.getResponse(String)`.
- [FIX] Too many bytes written exception caused by inconsistent encoding between UTF-8 and the
  JVM default. UTF-8 is now correctly used for the request body content length and throughout.
- [FIX] Fixed deserialization of `ReplicatorDocument` where the source or target url is a JSON
  object not a string.
- [FIX] Renew cookies when the server returns a 403 status code with `{"error":"credentials_expired"}`.
- [FIX] Cookie authentication now honours custom SSL configurations when making the `_session`
  request.

# 2.0.0 (2015-11-12)
- [NEW] `DesignDocument.MapReduce` now has a setter for the `dbcopy` field.
- [NEW] Requests for the `_all_docs` endpoint are made via `Database#getAllDocsRequestBuilder()`
  instead of using a view.
- [NEW] Introduced new view query API. More information is available in the javadoc,
  including usage and migration examples. Note the absence of an equivalent for `queryForStream()`.
  If you were using the `queryForStream()` method we would be interested in feedback about your use case.
  For example, if you were using the `InputStream` directly for streaming API parsing with an alternative
  JSON library we might be able to make this easier by handling the streams and providing a callback.
- [NEW] Optional OkHttp dependency for per CloudantClient instance connection pooling.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed `Database.batch(Object)` method. Using `batch=ok` is not recommended.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] JVM `http.maxConnections` configured pool is used by default for connection pooling.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed Apache HttpClient dependency. API methods that used HttpClient classes
  (e.g. `executeRequest`) now use `HttpConnection` instead.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `CloudantClient` public constructors and `ConnectionOptions` have been removed.
  `CloudantClient` instances are now created and have options configured using `ClientBuilder`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed these deprecated methods:
    * `CloudantClient.deleteDB(String, String)` use `CloudantClient.deleteDb(String)`,
    * `Database.invokeUpdateHandler(String, String, String)` use `Database.invokeUpdateHandler(String, String, Params)`,
    * `CloudantClient.setGsonBuilder(GsonBuilder)` use `ClientBuilder.gsonBuilder(GsonBuilder)`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed version 1.x view query API.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] LightCouch classes moved to package com.cloudant.client.org.lightcouch.
  This should only have a visible impact for `CouchDbException` and its subclasses.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed DbDesign class and replaced with DesignDocumentManager.
  If you were using the `getFromDesk` method, convert your design document directory to javascript
  files and use `DesignDocumentManager.fromFile(File)` or `DesignDocumentManager.fromDirectory(File)`.
  More information is available in the javadoc, including usage for de-serializing design document
  javascript files to `DesignDocument` objects.
- [FIX] Use the default port for the protocol when a client instance is created from a URL without
  specifying a port.

# 1.2.3 (2015-10-14)
- [NEW] Added Basic Auth for HTTP proxies. Configure via `ConnectOption#setProxyUser`
  and `ConnectOptions#setProxyPassword`.

# 1.2.2 (2015-10-01)
- [CHANGED] Added default of 5 minutes for both connection and socket timeouts instead of waiting forever.
- [UPGRADED] Upgraded Apache HttpClient from 4.3.3 to 4.3.6.

# 1.2.1 (2015-09-14)
- [FIXED] `org.apache.http.conn.UnsupportedSchemeException: http protocol is not supported`
  when using a proxy server with `http` and a server with `https`.

# 1.2.0 (2015-09-10)
- [FIXED] `NullPointerException` when parsing `{doc: null}` JSON in search or view results.

- [DEPRECATED] `com.cloudant.client.api.model.Page` setter methods.

# 1.1.2 (2015-08-14)

- [IMPROVED] Removed unconditional GET request when creating `Database` objects.
  This offered little protection to the developer while performing a hidden HTTP request.
- [FIXED] Fixed issue where URL parameters would be appended rather than replaced. This could cause very
  long URLs to be accidentally created.

# 1.1.0 (2015-07-31)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Hostname verification and certificate chain
  validation are now enabled by default. To disable these additional
  checks when the client connects to the database,
  `setSSLAuthenticationDisabled(true)` can be called on the `ConnectOptions`
  object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient` constructor.
- [NEW] New API for specifying the SSLSocketFactory. This can used to
  enhance security in specific environments. To set this SSLSocketFactory,
  call the `setAuthenticatedModeSSLSocketFactory` method on the
  `ConnectOptions` object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient`
  constructor.
- [NEW] New API for deleting databases, `CloudantClient.deleteDB(String name)`
