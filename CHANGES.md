# Unreleased
- [NEW] - Requests for the `_all_docs` endpoint are made via `Database#getAllDocsRequestBuilder()`
  instead of using a view.
- [NEW] - Introduced new view query API. More information is available in the javadoc,
  including usage and migration examples. Note the absence of an equivalent for `queryForStream()`.
  If you were using the `queryForStream()` method we would be interested in feedback about your use case.
  For example, if you were using the `InputStream` directly for streaming API parsing with an alternative
  JSON library we might be able to make this easier by handling the streams and providing a callback.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] - Removed Apache HttpClient dependency. API methods that used HttpClient classes
  (e.g. `executeRequest`) now use `HttpConnection` instead.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] - Removed version 1.x view query API.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] - LightCouch classes moved to package com.cloudant.client.org.lightcouch.
  This should only have a visible impact for `CouchDbException` and its subclasses.

  long URLs to be accidentally created.

# 1.1.0 (2015-07-31)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Hostname verification and certificate chain
  validation are now enabled by default. To disable these additional
  checks when the client connects to the database,

  object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient` constructor.
- [NEW] New API for specifying the SSLSocketFactory. This can used to
  enhance security in specific environments. To set this SSLSocketFactory,
  call the `setAuthenticatedModeSSLSocketFactory` method on the
  `ConnectOptions` object before you pass it to the `CloudantClient`
  constructor.
- [NEW] New API for deleting databases, `CloudantClient.deleteDB(String name)`
- [FIX] Fixed querying of next/previous page in a descending view.
- [FIX] Fixed handling of non-ASCII characters when the platform's
  default charset is not UTF-8.

  API.
