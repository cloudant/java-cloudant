		<para>
		LightCouch provides a Java persistence interface for CouchDB databases, 
		it defines a set of APIs for communicating with the RESTful JSON APIs
		provided by CouchDB.
		</para>
		<para>
		Through it's API, LightCouch offers a simple yet powerful persistence 
		interface, that is easy-to-use and lightweight.
		</para>
		<para> 
		LightCouch APIs was designed to offer a high degree of reliability and flexibility, 
		with minimal code base and dependency.
		</para>

	<section id="overview">
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para> 
		LightCouch API is presented by establishing a client to a database server instance.
		</para>
		<para>
		A LightCouch client is the central and primary gate way for gaining access to all 
		of the available APIs.
		</para>
		<para>
		The API in LightCouch is organized and grouped by functionality under different
		contexts, that is accessible via a client instance.
		</para>
		<para>
		The API is mainly focused on document persistence, supporting 
		<acronym>CRUD</acronym> (i.e Create Read Update Delete) kind of operations. 
		Another set of APIs for handling CouchDB Views and Design documents, and another 
		for performing database specific tasks such as database replication and compaction.
		</para>
		<para>
		Note: The API is covered by an integration unit tests packaged with the
		source code, see
		<ulink url="http://www.lightcouch.org/download.html">Download</ulink>.
		The API was tested against CouchDB up to version 1.1.1
		</para>

	<section id="setup">
		<title>Setup</title>
		<para>
		To setup LightCouch for use in your application, you need to have the
		binary distribution (along with it's dependencies) available to your 
		application classpath. Maven users could add the LightCouch dependency
		element to their application <literal>pom.xml</literal> file:

			<para>
			Typically prepare a file named <literal>couchdb.properties</literal>
			and make it available to your application default classpath. 
			A client knows how to find and parse this file to extract all the necessary

	<section id="using-lightCouch">
		<title>Using LightCouch</title>
		<para>
		As mentioned earlier, you have to create a client to start using the API.
		</para>
		<para>
		A client class is called <literal>org.lightcouch.CouchDbClient</literal>.
		It offers three convenient constructors for instantiating a new instance,
		or multiple instances if you wish to handle multiple databases simultaneously, 
		typically each client handles one database, in isolation.
		</para>
		<para>
		The easiest way to instantiate a new client is by using it's default 
		constructor, it will search your application default classpath for the file you
		have created earlier, i.e <literal>couchdb.properties</literal>
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
CouchDbClient dbClient = new CouchDbClient();
// API is ready to use
		]]></programlisting>
		<para>
		Another overloaded constructor accepts a properties file name to be supplied:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[  
CouchDbClient dbClient2 = new CouchDbClient("couchdb-2.properties");
            ]]></programlisting>
		<para>
		The final constructor accepts individual parameters to be supplied directly, 
		may be useful when using external files does not make sence in your environment, 
		or for dynamic creation of a client on the fly:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
CouchDbClient dbClient3 = new CouchDbClient(...);
            ]]></programlisting>
		<para>
		Note: A client instance is thread-safe, typically you would create one 
		at the beginning of your application startup and re-use it throughout 
		your code.
		</para>
		<para> 
		At the end of usage, it might be useful to shutdown a client's underlying 
		connection manager, and thus ensure a proper release of resources:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
dbClient.shutdown();
            ]]></programlisting>
		<section id="spring">
			<title>Spring Integration</title>
			<para>
			If you use Spring in your environment, it may be useful to define
			LightCouch clients as Spring beans, and let Spring DI 
			container handles initializing and injecting your client(s): 
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[  
<bean id="dbClient" class="org.couchy.CouchDbClient" destroy-method="shutdown"/> 
<bean id="dbClient2" class="org.lightcouch.CouchDbClient" destroy-method="shutdown"> 
  <constructor-arg value="couchdb-2.properties" /> 
</bean> 
			]]></programlisting>
			<para>
			Autowire a client to your Spring components:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
@Autowired 
private CouchDbClient dbClient;
			]]></programlisting>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section id="docs-api">
		<title>Documents API</title>
		<para>
		Document persistence API is accessible under a client instance directly. A
            LightCouch client acts as an <literal>EntityManager</literal> that is used in 
            JPA, it provides convenient methods for handling document persistence.
		</para>
		<para> 
            The API supports <literal>CRUD</literal> operations to be performed on documents.
        </para>
		<para>
		Documents in a CouchDB are mainly identified by declaring two fields, 
		an id and a revision (i.e <literal>_id</literal> and <literal>_rev</literal>).
		</para>
		<para>
		Your model data is required to declare those special fields to qualify as valid
		persisted documents.
		</para>
		<para>
		LightCouch provides a convenient base class which you may choose to extend by
		your model classes, this class is called <literal>org.lightcouch.Document</literal>.
		If it's not your flavor, or if you want your objects not to depend on LightCouch
		(this may be preferable as to promote models portability across different domains),
		you may use JSON mapping annotations 
		(i.e <literal>com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName("_id")</literal> for example),
		or, to get away with clean models, you may define those special fields by their naming
		convention (<literal>i.e String _id &amp; String _rev</literal>).
		</para>
		<para>
		LightCouch gives you the flexibility of choosing a model data most suitable to 
		your application, you may choose to work with raw streams, JSON objects, 
		Maps, and rich domain models.
		</para>
		<para>
		LightCouch has a dependency on Google <literal>Gson</literal> library which it 
		relies on for handling JSON/Java mapping. During serialization <literal>Gson</literal>
		by default will not serialize <literal>null</literal> fields.
		</para>
		<para>
		The following sections explores what LightCouch API offers for handling document 
		persistence.
		</para>
		
		<section id="docs-api-save">
			<title>Saving/Updating Documents</title>
			<para>
			Documents could be saved and updated by using methods conventiently 
			named <literal>save()</literal> and <literal>update()</literal>
			both methods takes an entity object as parameter. 
			<literallayout>
			An object may be one of: 
			1. A plain Java object (<literal>POJO</literal>). 
			2. A <literal>java.util.Map</literal> holding key/value pairs. 
			3. A <literal>com.google.gson.JsonObject</literal> object, which is a JSON representation class from <literal>Gson</literal>.
			</literallayout>
			</para>
			<para>
			When saving a new object, it worth to mention that LightCouch will
			generate an <literal>UUID</literal> for your object <literal>_id</literal> field
			before sending it over to the database, but only in case you left it blank.  
			</para>
			<para>
			Beside the usual saving operation, you may also use <literal>batch()</literal>, 
			which may be suitable for logging scenarios. 
			</para>
			<para>Usage Example:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
// initialize a client 'dbClient' here .. 
Foo foo = new Foo(); 
Response resp = dbClient.save(foo); 
// dbClient.save(foo);   // or save and ignore response 
// dbClient.batch(foo);  // saves as batch
Response resp2 = dbClient.update(foo);

Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
map.put("_id", "some-id");
map.put("a-list", Collections.EMPTY_LIST);
dbClient.save(map);

JsonObject json = new JsonObject();
json.addProperty("_id", "some-id-2");
json.add("an-array", new JsonArray());
dbClient.save(json); 
            ]]></programlisting>
			<para>
                  Normally when you persist an object to CouchDB, the database replies with
                  the document Id and revision, a <literal>Response</literal> object
                  holds this information.
			</para>
		</section> <!-- end save/update documents -->
		
		<section id="docs-api-find">
			<title>Finding Documents</title>
			<para>
			Retrieving documents API is offered by a convenient method 
			<literal>find()</literal>, it accepts a document id and or revision.
			<literallayout>
			As a return type, you may choose one of: 
			1. An <literal>InputStream</literal>. 
			2. A <literal>com.google.gson.JsonObject</literal> object.
			3. A plain Java object.
			</literallayout>
			A <literal>java.util.Map</literal> however does not qualify for a return type.
			</para>
			<para>
			An additional finder method <literal>findAny()</literal> is provided as to give more control over the query,
			typically use it to retrieve any kind of document when there is no equivalent API already supported by the client.
			Unlike other finder methods, this method expects a fully formatted and encoded URI to be supplied. 
			</para>
			<para>
			When working with streams, it is important to close it after usage to release the connection.
			</para>
			<para>Usage Example:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
// initialize a client 'dbClient' here ..  
Foo foo = dbClient.find(Foo.class, "some-id"); 
foo = dbClient.find(Foo.class, "some-id", "some-rev"); 
boolean b = dbClient.contains("some-id"); 

InputStream in = dbClient.find("some-id"); // find as stream 
// do something useful, close stream
in.close();

JsonObject json = dbClient.find(JsonObject.class, "some-id");

json = dbClient.findAny(JsonObject.class, dbClient.getDBUri().toString() + "any-uri");
				]]></programlisting>
		</section><!-- end find documents -->
		
		<section id="docs-api-delete">
			<title>Deleting Documents</title>
			<para>
			Following with the API, the respective method for deleting documents
			is <literal>remove()</literal>, which accepts both a document id and revision,
			and another overloaded which accepts an object. 
			</para>
			<para>Usage Example:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
// initialize a client 'dbClient' here ..   
Response resp = dbClient.remove(object); // object contains both an id and rev 
resp = dbClient.remove("some-id", "some-rev");
            ]]></programlisting>
		</section><!-- end delete documents -->
		
		<section id="docs-api-custom-serializer">
			<title>Custom Serializers</title>
			<para>
			Gson by default does not know how to handle serialization/deserialization of 
			some third party classes, for example JodaTime <literal>DateTime</literal> class.
			To workaround this limitation, you may register a custom serializer/deserializer
			via <literal>GsonBuilder</literal> then supply it to a CouchDbClient instance.
			</para>
			<para>Usage Example:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(DateTime.class, new JsonSerializer<DateTime>() {
public JsonElement serialize(DateTime src, Type typeOfSrc, 
JsonSerializationContext context) {
return new JsonPrimitive(src.toString());
}
});
		
gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(DateTime.class, new JsonDeserializer<DateTime>() {
public DateTime deserialize(JsonElement json, Type typeOfT, 
JsonDeserializationContext context) throws JsonParseException {
return new DateTime(json.getAsJsonPrimitive().getAsString());
}

	<section id="docs-api-attachments">
		<title>Attachments API</title>
		<para>
		Documents in CouchDB may have attachments, either inline  
		or standalone. The following sections illustrates both features.
		</para>
	<section id="docs-api-attachment-inline">
		<title>Inline Attachments</title>
		<para>
		To save an inline attachment, the class <literal>org.lightcouch.Attachment</literal> 
		exposes	properties for setting a base64 encoded string, and a content type of the attachment. 
		A document may have one or more inline attachments which get saved along with 
		the enclosing document during the usual save operation described above.
		</para>
		<para>
		To enable inline attachments in a domain model, one may extend 
		<literal>org.lightcouch.Document</literal> which provides 
		means for adding attachments, or if a domain does not 
		extend <literal>Document</literal>, see the example below.
		</para>
		<para>
		Retrieving a document that has an attachment does not also retrieve 
		the attachment itself, instead it returns metadata. 
		</para>
		<para>
		Note: For encoding base64 strings, 
		<literal>Base64.encodeBase64String(bytes)</literal> may be used, thats included in 
		Apache Codec.
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[

	<section id="docs-api-attachment-standalone">
		<title>Standalone Attachments</title>
		<para>
		Standalone attachments may be saved to an existing, or to 
		a new document. The supporting method expects an attachment in
		an <literal>InputStream</literal> format holding binary data, 
		and a "Content-Type" to be provided. The corresponding APIs for 
		saving attachments is available under a client instance.
		</para>
		<para>
		In the following example, the first statement saves an attachment under
		a newly created document (with a generated UUID as the document id).
		</para>
		<para>
		The second statement, saves an attachment under a document given a

	<section id="logging-error-handling">
		<title>Logging and Error Handling</title>
		<para>
		Logging may be useful during development, LightCouch is designed to provide 
		concise logging messages and report errors as you work with the API.
		</para>
		<section id="logging">
			<title>Logging</title>
			<para>
			By enabling a more verbose logging level 
			(i.e <literal>INFO</literal> for example), 
			LightCouch will log events as they occure. 
			You can get hold of useful information during development like what
			API calls is made, how a request URI and parameters look like, and what reply 
			the database has responsed as a result to your request.
			</para>
			<para> 
			If you are using <literal>Log4j</literal> in your application,  
			you may control logging levels like this:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
# Controls LightCouch logging

				]]></programlisting>
		</section>
		<section id="error-handling">
			<title>Error Handling</title>
			<para>
			In the event of failure, the API will throw specific exceptions
			in correspondence to the failed event, by proper handling from your
			application side, you can take the appropriate decision based on the
			exception that is being thrown.
			</para>
			<para>
			LightCouch provides three convenient runtime exception classes for that purpose.
			<literallayout>
			1. <literal>NoDocumentException</literal> when a requested document could not be found (or a view with no result).
			2. <literal>DocumentConflictException</literal>	when a conflict is detected during a save or update. 
			3. <literal>CouchDbException</literal> is the super class for the former two exception classes, for bravity, 
			it is thrown in every other failure events, i.e in cases of HTTP error (<literal>400</literal>) for instance. 
			</literallayout>	
			</para>
		</section>

	<section id="views-api">
		<title>Views API</title>
		<para>
		The API for CouchDB views is accessible via a client instance under a 
		special context <literal>view(String)</literal> which accepts a view name,
		consisting of the design document name and the view name
		(i.e <literal>example/foo</literal> for example)
		this results in requesting a view with the full URI of <literal>_design/example/_view/foo</literal>
		</para>
		<para>
            The API employs a <literal>Builder</literal> pattern for constructing views 
            query requests by chaining the appropriate parameters that makes sence for 
            a specific view. Query a view given a Complex key is tightly integrated in the API.
            </para>
		<para>
		Views query is supported by a number of options you may choose from, as per a use case:
		<literallayout>
		1. <literal><![CDATA[List<T>]]></literal> A list of a specified type.
		2. <literal>InputStream</literal> raw streaming.
		3. Scalar values (i.e <literal>int</literal> etc.)
		4. View entries (keys/values) as they reside in the database B-Tree.
		5. Pagination.

		<section id="pagination">
			<title>Pagination</title>
			<para>
			The Pagination API provides means for displaying an effective paging that supports

			</para>
			<para>
			A <literal><![CDATA[Page<T>]]></literal> object holds useful information for 
			displaying a featured pagination with lowest effort possible from your part.
			</para>
			<para>
			Following is an example of using the API in a web application,

		A <literal>DesignDocument</literal> object that is used to carry a design document, 
		properly implements <literal>equals()</literal>.
		This may come in handy for comparing documents that are loaded from either 
		desk files or the database, this is what practically is used when 
		<literal>synchronizeWithDb()</literal> is invoked, as to avoid un-necessary
		updates to a design document in the database that is up-to-date.

			<title>Replication</title>
			<para>
			LightCouch provides two subset of APIs for handling database replication, 
			it supports the traditional replication that is issued by POSTing to
			<literal>_replicate</literal>	URI, and the newer replicator database
			(i.e <literal>_replicator</literal> by default) that is
			introduced with CouchDB version 1.1.0 A replication request
			is triggered by saving a document in the replicator database, 
			and is canceled by removing the document that triggered the replication.
			</para>
			<para>Usage Example:</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
ReplicationResult result = dbClient.replication()
.source("source-db")
.target("http://user:secret@127.0.0.1:5984/target-db") 
.createTarget(true)
.trigger();
 
// the following targets a replicator database 
Replicator replicator = dbClient.replicator()

.replicatorDB("_myreplicator") // optional, defaults to _replicator
.replicatorDocId("doc-id")     // optional, defaults to an UUID
